old anyone outside of our group anything. Everyone got home safe...but not the 
same. Copper went with The Kids back to Los Angeles, he was holding hands with 
Emily. I am more than sure he kissed her long and good. He always talked about 
her hair and she even wore his jacket on the train...she loved trains.

said with a giggle, ‚ÄúI never realized how short you were compared to Jake and
 Lawrence.‚Äù I stared at her and stood quiet, half offended and half laughing 
on the inside. I hugged her and kissed her head and we got to my friends house,
 Davian. He was a cool dude, I met him in East Los Angeles but he moved out to 
the suburbs. He had dark really cool wavy hair and was sort of short but man he
 was way stronger than you‚Äôd ever expect. He was on one and a bunch of people
 were passed out at his party, I didn‚Äôt realize it was January first.

*\par He walked up and gave Grace and I hugs and offered drinks or a smoke and 
we declined and I just spoke to him, hearing an old friend's voice was amazing 
right about now. Grace enjoyed the conversation and ate an apple. I see now why
 she has abs...can't relate not entirely at least. Davian was up in the clouds 
and was speaking about the universe and the new year, we had told him eventuall
y that we didn‚Äôt do much for new years. He grabbed a sparkler and beer and sh
ook it and started re celebrating as if the clock just turned twelve for new ye
ars and demanded Grace and I kiss...so we did. After ten minutes he was out lik
e a baby, but he would never know how much I really liked his conversation and 
needed it.

*\par Me and Grace walked to a Hilton and they surprisingly had a room open and
 we slept like babies ourselves after our first session of the new year, someth
ing about her and what she had...I was never going to get tired of that thing m
an...but more importantly I was never going to get tired of her. I could only h
ope she felt the same and feels the same after many many years‚Ä¶.because I kno
w I would. I really love Grace. It was four in the morning and we crashed. I wa
s asleep and exhausted, I was happy Grace held one of my hands across her chest
 along with her hair in my face.

*\par I woke up to Grace watching t.v. and still in bed under the blankets, it 
was 2 in the afternoon. I kissed her cheek and went to the restroom and brushed
 my teeth and wet my hair and shaved, I had almost a beard and...at just eighte
en that wasn‚Äôt the look I wanted to give off. Grace‚Äôs haircut wasn‚Äôt terr
ible and still stood relatively short enough but, my waves and curls were still
 there and my sides didn‚Äôt bug me, so I couldn‚Äôt complain. My hair got dark
er and thicker. It was all black now and thick...but not oily, Grace‚Äôs hair w
as darker itself but still blonde. We both for some reason lost more weight, th
e bruises on my face were just outlined and I stopped waking up sore and could 
walk normally again.

cked and grabbed the pair of scissors at the hotel. I rushed out of the bathroo
m and Grace walked through the hall and said, ‚ÄúWoah...calm the hell down I or
dered the lunch room service.‚Äù I stopped and looked through the door‚Äôs eye 
window, I saw a man with a chef hat holding a tray with wheels . I let out a bu
nch of breaths to calm down. Grace was wearing just her underwear and my shirt 
from the night before with her messed up hair, her feet were also bare. I said,
 ‚ÄúPut something on your legs...don't want the room service guy staring. Not t
oday I don't want to fight anyone any time soon.‚Äù She laughed and grabbed my 
jeans which were too big and just slid them on without even buttoning them up a
nd opened the door.

ht ounce steak, with garlic and caramelized onions. With a bucket of ice along 
with a bucket of neapolitan ice cream...correct?‚Äù Grace replied with ‚ÄúSure.
..I think so, that sounds bomb.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize Grace has probably never 
ordered room service or stood in a hotel like this, in my younger years I have 
even stayed in penthouses in Las Vegas. The chef stared at her, Grace realized 
she was messing up and looked at me for help and I, in my underwear and a muscl

said, ‚ÄúThe room?‚Äù He replied with, ‚ÄúB, number fifty two, third floor sir.

ed my hand out and he handed it to me and I scanned the cart and read the recei
pt, he had it all there and grabbed my wallet and paid for it with a twenty dol

went to our homes, she saw her brother again and her mom and dad weren‚Äôt home
. I went to my home then saw both of my brothers and my ma. She was mad but...I
 had a secret to tell her which made her cry but happy at the same time. My bro

met my baby brother, which was nice, really nice actually.

 the idea of Grace and my mom in the same room for over a minute...not the best
 idea in the world. I got myself an Arizona with some chips and Grace a bag of 
jerky, she also was the only girl I knew who willingly liked it. By the time we
 got back Grace had red cheeks and a small cut on her lip. I realized she was d
ying to leave, she was biting her lip so often that it cut. When my brother ope

*\par First I hugged The Auk who now had a nice home running in the front of th
e apartments which looked pretty nice. I had to thank him for caring and choosi
ng to stay and help when I needed him and no questions asked, I decided I would
 tell him about everything. He was in woah and awe. He was worried and asked if
 they would be back, my answer was simply ‚ÄúI aint sure.‚Äù It was a pretty ca
lm place after that and eventually we left by early sundown. Next, I parked the
 bike on Whittier in front of the WSS. By now the cruising had started, believe
 it or not, living in East L.A. as long as I did, I never saw the cruising up c
lose. We walked to each kids house individually and thanked each of them, to wh
ich just about all of them cried. I realized these kids were sent into a warzon
e, but for me...they did it and for that, I was forever grateful.

ore we left, I saw an old friend. Brooke was walking with her friends, she waiv
ed hi and was wearing an all black Adidas outfit. She smiled and that smile cou
ld shine through the clouds if she wanted it to. I remembered when she was the 
only person I knew here, she was the first person I met when I first came to Ea
st LA. I don't have a ton of memories with Brooke, but even on my dying days, t
hat smile could still shine bright enough to give me a few more seconds of brea
th. I'd be leaving soon, to show Grace her surprise. I have my friends here and
 everything, if something ever went wrong...I think Brooke‚Äôs smile would shin
e the way back believe it or not. She was a very good friend and was human and 
that‚Äôs what I admire most about her. She continued walking but, I know we hav
e stories we can share smiling. I do hope I will see her again but...until then

*\par Across the street, through the lowriders along with the men and women in 
them. Stood Delilah at 5'3, now even taller in high heels and her tight clothes
. In front of the Nike store, in a sundress and full face of makeup that she di
dn't need on. She didn't have to try hard to show off, she really didn't need t
he dress like that either. Her eyes were intense and had seen a lot. She wasn't
 fazed by any of it and if she was, she would never show it to anyone. I didn't
 know her all that well, she was the first girl I had ever seen in a Garfield c
lassroom. She matched the colors, red, blue, green and orange with a lot of bla
ck surrounding her. She owned them all with pride. As I left I questioned if I'
d ever see her again, I wish I got to know her better. I never did. I did wish 
her the best as I started the bike and began to ride away with Grace.

 back here? It‚Äôs the same place after you had that incident. Did you start so
mething again and I just didn‚Äôt see?!‚Äù She kept asking questions which I de
clined all of them and I didn‚Äôt lie once.

*\par She caught the keys and froze while doing so. After about thirty seconds 
she replied with, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She walked to me and dropped the duffle bag, put 
her arms on my shoulders then repeated it again, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I grabbed one hand
 and walked up the driveway to the door. I put her hand with the keys to the do
or. She put the keys in the lock on the door and had watery eyes and a smile an
d opened it. It was dark and I flipped the light switch on behind her. The ligh
t showed a table to our right which was the dining room, upstairs about fifteen
 to twenty feet tall with matte white walls. The tile beneath us was white and 
squared and to our right was a mudroom and the garage. She walked into the othe
r room with a kitchen to her right and living room to our left, about thirty fe
et long of space. The kitchen had granite countertops, two ovens one on top of 
the other, a few feet away from that was the stove. It had eight burners and th
e sink was really big and stainless steel. There was a granite island too, with
 stools, four of them.

*\par Along all of this, the living room was a solid, ten to fifteen steps away
. The living room had a t.v. that was at the least, sixty to eighty inches. It 
was huge. There was a huge sectional couch and a ottoman in the middle. The car
pet was beige and the couch was brown and suede. There was a closet underneath 
the stairs, next to the living room was a bathroom. Next to the bathroom there 
was an empty bedroom for a guest I guess. We had already seen the upstairs, exc
ept my room had a new bed and a dresser and cubicle already. We had seven bedro
oms in the house, and the upstairs loft had a conversation pit.

*\par Next up, we Grace ran from her room and tackled me into the pit that was 
so soft, it smelled so good. She layed on top and asked, ‚ÄúWe made a ton of mo
ney...but how did you do this?‚Äù I smiled, I couldn‚Äôt help it and answered h
er question with, ‚ÄúI technically didn‚Äôt. Since we won the fight...that jerk
 of an agent we met in San Francisco offered a gift, this is what I wanted. Bes
t part is...you haven‚Äôt even checked the garage.‚Äù She got off, flew down th
e stairs, I won't lie, I was way slower then her. She saw it finally, her new m
otorcycle. Also with a matching car. She had her brother‚Äôs old BMW bike and a
 new BMW to match it. Both were colored black and white with blue.

*\par Next to those was a gym, a squat rack, a bench and weights with a treadmi
ll. I planned on using them all. The backyard had grass, a field goal post and 
a half court basketball hoop. We were going to be really happy here. We walked 
back up the stairs just imagining all the parties we would throw, breakfast we 
would make, the dinners and movie nights. So many things to look forward to..I 
kind of felt, we deserved this. I could even give my friends a few things back 
to them for thanks, even though I am not someone to give gifts as return as tha
nks. I saw it as a start and...was thankful I was able to keep Grace. She stuck
 around through way too much, rides through cold weather, gross dusty motel roo
ms, firefights, holidays, hunger, bar fights, me being dead for two days...you 
name, Grace didn‚Äôt go anywhere.

 but I was whispering because I don't want to jinx it. She didn‚Äôt sleep in he

 I was almost asleep by four and I thought she was too so I told her, ‚ÄúI have
 my eyes closed right now..and I am hoping you will stay, not for the things we
 have or memories we made but for...me. I fear we will grow apart...I know peop

*\par To that, I decided I couldn‚Äôt sleep and sat in the window seal. Not for
 very long and eventually I fell to sleep right next to her...as happy as a guy
 ever could be. I honestly couldn‚Äôt wait to wake up just to see Grace enjoy e
verything all over.

*\par I woke up at ten in the morning, Grace wasn‚Äôt next to me. As a matter o
f fact, I was alone...in the queen size bed with white and grey sheets and blan
kets. I sat up and heard rain outside. I could see grey skies outside through t
he blue arrowed and white curtains. The air around me was cold, being in underw
ear and a muscle shirt wasn‚Äôt the wisest decision for clothing. I got out of 
bed and brushed my teeth, showered too. I was quiet...I wanted to hear Grace or
 something from her but...to my luck, I heard nothing.

*\par I put on some sweat, they were black and hugged my ankles. Then I found a
 long sleeve shirt a size too big but no complaints and I rolled the sleeves up
 a bit then threw some black ankle socks. I then walked out of the room and clo
sed the door behind me...the pit had nobody in there, I checked the other rooms
, bathrooms then eventually led up to Grace‚Äôs room...to no luck. Still no Gra
ce, although she did leave one of her dressers open. I walked downstairs, it wa
s colder down there then upstairs, you could still hear the rain though. I went
 through everything downstairs, yet still no Grace. I had to take a second to m
yself...her car and bike were still here...she didn‚Äôt take anything...why wou
ld she leave? After about a half hour I lost my patience and started yelling an
d walking fast around the house and looking for Grace.

*\par I went to her room, everywhere...I sat on her bed and felt an odd thump. 
I looked around and the room was quiet, nothing happened. I sat once again, the
 thump came...I wasn‚Äôt that heavy. I was confused, so I got off and felt the 
bed lift with me. Thebed lifted three or four feet off the ground and there was
 a staircase with lights going down. It was like a secret passage in the movies
. I went down it, very cautiously. I ended up fifteen feet down and opened a do
or, inside was a bunker looking room then I saw her, Grace. She was reading a b
ook then looked up at me and said, ‚ÄúOh, good morning.‚Äù I yelled at her and 
said, ‚ÄúWHY DIDN‚ÄôT YOU TELL ME THERE WAS A WHOLE SECRET ROOM???‚Äù

*\par She laughed and said, ‚ÄúSorry, I just got into this book. It‚Äôs called 
The Great Gatsby...it‚Äôs pretty nice. I am going to read Gone With The Wind ne
xt...but I am sorry.‚Äù She hugged me with the book still in her hand and we le
ft the bunker room. We made cookies, she wanted the crunchy ones. I prefer when
 the cookies are easy to bite into. I made canela and coffee then drank both...
she just drank coffee. After watching a movie I realized something. ‚ÄúGrace...
I didn‚Äôt get you anything for Christmas did I?‚Äù She got off me then put her
 coffee down and with a cookie followed by, ‚ÄúYou got me a house...that‚Äôs a 
gift...I didn‚Äôt get you anything but...be right back.‚Äù She ran up the stair
s, I think she even fell once while up stairs and I threw on christmas music. S
he came down with a surprisingly fast wrapped gift, but Grace is a master wrapp
er so no questions asked. I opened it, it was a skateboard. She said, ‚ÄúThe ag
ent left it in the bunker thing...it goes over thirty miles per hour and they m
ade it to have a remote and everything...the wonders our nation can do huh?‚Äù

*\par I hugged her tight and loved the board...I kinda considered the shoes she
 bought me a gift but I guess she didn‚Äôt. We made dinner, sang music that the
 neighbors down the block could hear and we weren‚Äôt even close to making a so
und next to it. We slow danced, I wasn‚Äôt that great. She sang and claimed she
 would break my heart...maybe later but...not tonight due to her singing. She d
id sing well though. Eventually, we got back to the roof and continued the danc
e. Still nobody fell off the roof, we eventually went back to bed. The clouds w
ere gone and we eventually rolled back into bed.
